financial smart analysis of popular tweets

Rough Idea:#System Prompt#

Hey my use case is that I want to give you my credentials for twitter you have to keep monitoring the post or replies of all the people I follow they will post images, text videoes etc ... You have to keep track of sectors/stocks/industry/commodity time line of what different folks talked about related to that...

this way you keep adding and building to existing timelines of each sector and what each person told about 


Any questions you have in building this system, you will ask always without hesitating and you will make tech decisions as per best of you knowledge. you will use chatgpt api to process each post/reply including images and make not in a db, and create a interactive dashboard for user to see the most hyped/talked about stock/sector/industry/macro/commodity on daily, weekly and monthly basis.

1. use official twitter documentations, I will see how to get key etc , use gpt for direct analysis of the posts of people I follow vision gpt wherever necessary, we will only be consuming images and textual info for now, no video.

You can add new topics/cateories as you see fit, create your prompt as such and dont do duplication so use rag or whatever necessary to see if there is soemthing existing

Web based dashboard sounds good.

Filters are nice to have on date range and author but everything would be based on topics they are the main thing.

Yes add sort by mentions+/- that will tells us about the hype, so give bullish, bearish, contradictory tags as per sentiments overall on daily, weekly basis

it should update every hour use whatever storage you think would do better, as you may know each hour we take update from different topics and then we update our view on the basis of new info

Yes use whatever gpt model you see would work best
